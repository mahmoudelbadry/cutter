# Cutter

Cutter is a webapp that takes a paragraph and cuts it into multipart tweets (1/3) , (2/3) .. etc.

It uses [Pure CSS framework](http://purecss.io/) and [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) and it's written in Vanilla Javascript

You can use it [here](http://mahmoudelbadry.github.io/cutter/)


##Contributing

You have to have [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) with [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) installed to contribute to cutter.

After you have them installed, just run

```bash
bower install
```
If there's anything you think can be done better, just send me a [pull request](https://github.com/mahmoudelbadry/cutter/pulls)

##Support

I wrote cutter in vanilla Javascript because wanted to learn the new DOM APIs, so you'll need a modern browser to use cutter.

Currently it has been tested on Chrome and Firefox, cutter should work on IE10+ as well but I haven't tested it yet.

##TODO
1. Check for mobile support.
2. Implement IE9 support (currently everything works except the placeholder attribute)
